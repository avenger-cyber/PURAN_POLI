Preparing Puran
Rinse the chana dal first very well in water. I didnâ€™t soaked the chana dal but you can also soak the chana dal for 30 minutes to one hour and then drain the water.
In a pressure cooker, cook the chana dal for 6 to 7 whistles. The dal has to be cooked well. If you soak the chana dal, the cooking time will be reduced. Once the pressure settles down on its own, strain the cooked dal. The dal has to be strained well.
Keep the stock aside. This stock can be used for making katachi amti which is a thin tempered dal or you can just add it to your veggie dishes or roti.
Heat ghee in a pan and add the ground ginger powder, ground nutmeg powder, ground cardamom powder and ground fennel powder. Fry for a few seconds on a low heat.
Add the chana dal and jaggery. Stir and let this puran mixture cook on a low flame till the mixture becomes dry.
Keep on stirring the puran mixture at intervals.
Once the puran stuffing become dry and thick, switch off the flame.
Let it cool and then mash the puran mixture with a potato masher. You can also use your mixer to mash the puran mixture very well. Keep aside.


Preparing The Poli Dough
Meanwhile take whole wheat flour, all purpose flour and salt in a bowl mix well.
Add a little bit of water and ghee and mix. Begin to knead the dough adding water as required.
The dough should be smooth and soft. Cover and keep aside the dough for 15-20 minutes.



Making Puran Poli
Take a medium or large size ball from the dough. Roll it 2 to 3 inches in circumference on a dusted rolling board.
Place a portion of puran mixture in the center of the rolled dough.
Bring the edges together towards the center. Join all the edges and pinch them.
Sprinkle some flour and start rolling the dough.
Make a medium or large circle (poli) as depending upon the size of the dough and puran filling you took.
On a heated tawa or griddle, spread some ghee. Place the rolled poli/dough circle on the tawa.
When one side gets browned, turn over and cook the other side till you see some brown spots.
Once the second side gets browned, then turn over and apply ghee. If everything is done properly then puran poli will puff up. The poli should be cooked well with brown spots and golden.
Make all puran polis this way and stack them in a casserole or in a kitchen napkin.
You can serve puran poli warm or at room temperature with milk, ghee or curd (yogurt).
